This project was made for participating in an event held at IIT kanpur(Techkriti 2019) called IARC, in which a bot
has to perform specific tasks like line following, maze solving, wall following, node detection and counting and distance 
measurement. The microontroller that i used was Arduino Nano and besides this i used basic components like motor Driver
IR Sensor array and ultrasonic sensors.</br>
I have broken the program into parts and then integrated it into a single program as per my needs.
